# Glaucoma_detection using ViT architecture.
Our project focuses on glaucoma detection using the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, requires early and accurate detection for effective management. By leveraging the power of ViT, our model processes retinal images to identify signs of glaucoma with high precision. The transformer-based approach allows for improved feature extraction and classification compared to traditional methods. This project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and aid ophthalmologists in early detection efforts.
